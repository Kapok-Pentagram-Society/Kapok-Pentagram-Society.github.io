# Kapok Pentagram Society

木棉五芒星社于2023年夏季成立，原本是[南粤激流艺术联合](https://fluxus-cantonia.org)（现激流学社）下属的一个专门翻译和研究神秘学和新异教的组织，现在是我个人在运营。当时，我还在修习威卡教，有感于中文地区新异教研究的缺乏，决定开始翻译一些北美改革宗德鲁伊和阿格里帕的资料；这就是这个组织的开端。当然，无论是当时的我还是现在作为基督徒的我，都不相信魔法和神秘学如同文学作品中所说的那样具备直接影响物理世界的能力；然而假如修习者足够虔诚，这些东西大抵会通过他本人的精神状态而间接产生一点有限的后果。在这个意义上，基督徒的祈祷跟威卡巫师的魔法仪式，在完全不相信这些东西的人看来，大抵不会有什么本质上的区别；而对于他们，这里的内容至少也足以胜任写幻想小说时用于构思世界观之类的事情的参考的角色。

The Kapok Pentagram Society was established in the summer of 2023. Originally, it was an organization under [Fluxus Cantonia Art Collective](https://fluxus.cantonia.org) (now Fluxus Society Cantonia) dedicated to translating and researching mysticism and neo-paganism. It is now personally operated by me. At the time, I was studying Wicca and, noting the lack of neo-pagan studies in Chinese-speaking regions, decided to begin translating materials on Reformed Druids and Agrippa. This marked the inception of the organization. Of course, neither the former me nor my current self as a Christian believes that magic and mysticism possess the direct ability to influence the physical world as depicted in literary works. However, if a practitioner is sufficiently devout, these practices may indirectly produce some limited effects through their mental state. In this sense, Christian prayers and Wiccan magical rituals might not seem fundamentally different to those who entirely disbelieve in such things. For them, at the very least, the content here should serve as a useful reference for constructing worldviews in fantasy novels or similar creative endeavors.
